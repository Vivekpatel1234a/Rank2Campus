## 📖 Introduction
**Rank2Campus** is a sophisticated, end-to-send web application designed to streamline the complex college admission and career counselling process. By integrating state-of-the-art AI and predictive analytics, it empowers students to make data-driven decisions about their academic future.

## 🧠 Theoretical Background
In the traditional education system, career counselling often suffers from information asymmetry and manual processing delays. Rank2Campus addresses these challenges through several core pillars:

1.  **Predictive Analytics for Admissions**: Using historical admission data, the system implements a recommendation engine that matches a student's rank with potential college branches. This reduces the "trial and error" approach in choice filling.
2.  **AI-Driven Decision Support**: Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide personalized guidance. Unlike static FAQs, the AI Counsellor understands context, helping students explore career paths based on their interests and current academic standing.
3.  **Automated Document Processing (OCR)**: By utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR), the system automates the verification of academic transcripts (PDFs/Images), minimizing human error and accelerating the onboarding process.
4.  **Semantic Design Philosophy**: The interface is built on a semantic design system, ensuring accessibility and a consistent user experience across different themes (Dark/Light mode).
